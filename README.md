# Simulation Sub-Team Online Assesment

We appreciate your interest in the software simulation sub-team and UBC Solar!

To evaluate how well you can interact with some of the prerequisite knowledge for this role, we have designed an online assessment for you.

If selected, you will be questioned during the interview about your solution to gauge how effectively you can defend and explain technical solutions.

## The Assesment
For this assessment, we want you to simulate how fast a ball might roll down an incline. You may assume that the ball begins its motion at the top and is stationary at first, and that the ball does not slip while rolling.

**Your task is to write a function that returns a ball's velocity after rolling down an incline.**

### Parameters

The input to this function is described in the `oa.py` file and is as follows:
- Height (_h_): the height of the incline (meters)
- Mass: the mass of the ball (kilograms)
- Length (_l_): the length of the slope (meters)
- Incline (_Î¸_): the angle of the slope (degrees)

**At the very least, you should utilise the height parameter in your answer. However, as a bonus, you may try to create a more realistic model utilising any of the other parameters passed.**

Please provide at least two test cases for this function.
If you find that coding the solution is too difficult, you can submit a response in words instead. However, we strongly urge you to provide some code in addition to that.

## Submission

Upload your `oa.py` or the text file you produced as a response to this directly to the application form!
