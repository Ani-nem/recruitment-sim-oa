'''
Returns the velocity of a ball after that has rolled down an incline.
height: the height of the incline (meters)
mass: the mass of the ball (kilograms)
length: the length of the slope (meters)
incline: the angle of the slope (degrees)
kinetic friction coefficient: kinetic friction coefficient of the slope's surface (0.0 - 1.0)
